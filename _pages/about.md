I'm currently a PhD candidate studying Computer Science at [WPI](http://www.wpi.edu/academics/cs/). I am advised by [Professor Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst) as a member of the [Data Science Research Group](href="http://davis.wpi.edu:8180/DSRG/).

My interests include data mining and machine learning, human-computer interaction, and algorithmic fairness. In particular I work on ranking tasks like evaluating candidates for hiring or lending, comparing the economic competetiveness of different regions, or guiding decision makers to find relevant results.  Recent projects include developing and evaluating [interactive ranking tools](http://rankit.wpi.edu) and designing [pairwise fairness metrics](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cakuhlman/publications/fare.pdf) for identifying unfair bias in rankings.

I believe public data can be used to solve social problems. In the summer of 2016 I was a member of the inaugural class of [Data Science for Social Good](https://www.research.ibm.com/science-for-social-good/) Fellows at IBM Research.

This site is under construction - please see my CV for publications and experience. I am currently on the job market!
