I'm currently a PhD candidate studying Computer Science at [WPI](http://www.wpi.edu/academics/cs/). I am advised by [Professor Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst) as a member of the [Data Science Research Group](href="http://davis.wpi.edu:8180/DSRG/).

I'm interested in data mining and machine learning, human-computer interaction, and algorithmic fairness. In particular I work on ranking tasks like evaluating candidates for hiring or lending, comparing the economic competetiveness of different regions, or guiding decision makers to find relevant results.  Recent projects include developing and evaluating [interactive ranking tools]() and designing [pairwise fairness metrics]() for identifying unfair bias in rankings.

I'm interested in using public data to solve social problems. In the summer of 2016 I was a member of the inaugural class of [Data Science for Social Good]() Fellows at IBM Research.
