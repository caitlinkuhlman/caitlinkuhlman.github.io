title: "FARE: Diagnostics for Fair Ranking using Pairwise Error Metrics."

permalink: /publication/2019-FARE
excerpt: 'In this work we propose to broaden the scope of fairness assessment, which heretofore has largely been limited to classification tasks, to include error-based fairness criteria for rankings. Our approach supports three criteria: Rank Equality, Rank Calibration, and Rank Parity, which cover a broad spectrum of fairness considerations from proportional group representation to error rate similarity. The underlying error metrics are formulated to be rank-appropriate, using pairwise discordance to measure prediction error in a model agnostic fashion. Based on this foundation, we then design a fairness auditing mechanism which captures group differences throughout the entire ranking, generating in-depth, nuanced diagnostics. We demonstrate the efficacy of our error metrics using real-world scenarios, exposing trade-ofs among fairness criteria and providing guidance in the selection of fair-ranking algorithms.'
