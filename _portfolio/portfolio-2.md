[RanKit](http://rankit.wpi.edu) is an interactive prototype ranking tool for building your own rankings based on
a small set of input preferences. Rnkit offers 3 types of interaction: build a sublist of items, group items into categories, or 
compare pairs of items to give the system a sample of your preferences. Then a ranking over all the items in the dataset is automatically generated.
You can try out the tool using a number of sample data sets including colleges, movies, and US states.

The Rankit System was developed and evaluated by a team of undergrad students at WPI for their Major Qualifying Project 
under the supervision of Caitlin Kuhlman.

Our 2018 CIKM [demo paper](https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N673720) describes the system in detail and provides case studies for personalized ranking.

Our 2019 SIGCHI [paper](https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N673729) provides and in-depth evaluation of different ranking interaction modes using a crowdsourced user study 
and a theoretical analysis of the tradeoffs between user effort required and rank quality.
